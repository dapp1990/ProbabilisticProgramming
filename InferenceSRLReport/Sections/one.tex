\todo[inline]{Not sure if the 6th clause of the network variable A in~\ref{enc1Encoding} is correctly substituted due to the property describe in the paper "Consider again Figure 1 and imagine that the parameter \(\theta{c1|a1}\) were 0. Given that this parameter is known to be 0, all models that set this parameter variable to true will have weight 0."}


\todo[inline]{For~\ref{enc2Encoding}, should we also chance the closure that contains a probability of 0, like we did in the ENC1 encoding? Look comment above}

Tables~\ref{logicalEnc1} and~\ref{logicalEnc2} show the logical variables used for encoded the Bayesian Network in~\cite{bayesian_network}.

Tables~\ref{cnfRepresentationEnc1} and~\ref{enc1Encoding} represent the encoded Bayesian Network using ENC1 and table~\ref{weightsEnc1} contains the corresponding weights.
