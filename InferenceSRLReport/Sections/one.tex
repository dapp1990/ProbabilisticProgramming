\section{Probabilistic Inference Using Weighted Model Counting}
\subsection{PGM to CNF}

Table~\ref{variableDescription} shows the semantics of the domain variables used for those tasks.

Tables~\ref{logicalEnc1} and~\ref{logicalEnc2} show the logical variables used for encoding the Bayesian Network.

Table~\ref{cnfRepresentationEnc1} represents the encoded Bayesian Network using ENC1 and table~\ref{weightsEnc1} contains the corresponding weights.

Likewise, table~\ref{cnfRepresentationEnc2} represents the encoded Bayesian Network using ENC2 and table~\ref{weightsEnc2} contains the corresponding weights.

\subsection{SRL to CNF}

First the program must be grounded, while taking into account \textbf{Q} and \textbf{E}. In this case the evidence set \textbf{E} is empty (there is no evidence available). The grounding process of the queries will be described step-by-step in listings~\ref{lst:query15} and~\ref{lst:query16}.  If only \textbf{query(path(1,5))} was considered, then \textbf{edge(5,6)} and \textbf{edge(2,6)} would have been irrelevant. With the inclusion of \textbf{query(path(1,6))} all edges become relevant.
